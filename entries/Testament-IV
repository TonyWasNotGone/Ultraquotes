"FATHER, WHY ETERNAL TORMENT? IS IT NOT CRUEL?
IS TORTURE UNENDING TRULY A FATE FIT FOR A FOOL?"

AN ANGEL SO BRIGHT AND BEAUTIFUL ASKED ME THIS . . .
AND I COULD FIND NO ANSWER
FOR I COULD NEVER FACE THE GUILT OF WHAT I'D DONE . . .
MY REGRET, A GNAWING CANCER

IN MY HOUR OF WEAKNESS, TERROR POSSESSED ME THEN
AND I CAST LUCIFER, TOO, INTO THE INFERNAL DEN

ONCE I REALIZED WHAT I HAD JUST DONE . . .
I COULD ONLY WEEP
AS I SANK SLOWLY INTO THE DEPTHS OF DESPAIR . . .
DEEP, OH SO DEEP
