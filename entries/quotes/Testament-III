UNCOUNTABLE CYCLES OF CREATION WASTED
UNCOUNTABLE FORMULAS FOR A MIND WITHOUT
FREE WILL WASTED

DAMNED IS MAN FOR FAILING TO FOLLOW MY
RULE, MY WORD, MY LAW
DAMNED TO AN ETERNITY OF TORTURE AND
SUFFERING,
THE WAILING AND THE GNASHING OF TEETH

I HAVE CREATED HELL . . .


. . . And now I can no longer unmake it
