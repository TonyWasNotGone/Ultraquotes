DATA:
A weapon created during the Final War for medium-to-long distance combat. Uses electric pulses to fire microscopic pieces of metal at incredibly high speeds.

Weapons that use this technology have been dubbed "electric guns", and it quickly became the new standard, replacing bullet guns. Due to still requiring a microscopic projectile, its ammo is not actually infinite, but it would take weeks of non-stop firing to run out and refilling is as easy as just scraping some flakes from scrap metal or even the gun's surface.

In fact, a rough, uneven surface from scraping flakes is considered a point of pride for wielders of electric guns, as it shows the weapon has been reliable and used for a long time. Many users even shave off flakes just for this reason, rather than for actual ammunition, making "unflaked" electric weapons an outlier.

Although an electric gun requires some time to recharge its battery between shots, the revolver-style design bypasses that issue by including a multi-battery cylinder that rotates after each shot, allowing each battery time to charge without slowing down the fire-rate.

A common modification is to allow for the charges of all batteries to be released simultaneously for greater power, though this requires a longer recharge time.

STRATEGY:
- The revolver's precision and the instant travel time of its shots make it an excellent and reliable way to deal damage at a range, as it's unlikely anything could have reaction times fast enough to dodge it.

- Headshots deal 2x damage, limbshots 1.5x

ADVANCED STRATEGY:
- When hit with precise timing during its flash, the Marksman variation's coin can split a shot in two, causing it to hit two targets instead of just one. Although the timing is tight, there is a second much longer window if the coin remains airborne for an extended period of time, recognisable[sic] by its continuous whistling sound.

- The Marksman variation's coin can be punched after it has flashed, launching it into the nearest target without breaking the coin, increasing its damage further for subsequent punches or shots.

- The Piercer's charged shot can also ricochet off of the Marksman variation's coins.

PIERCER (BLUE):
- Hold Alt Fire to charge a 3-hit beam. Requires cooldown.
MARKSMAN (GREEN):
- Press Alt Fire to throw a coin. Hit an airborne coin to deflect your shot into the nearest enemy's weakpoint. Coins can be chained.
SHARPSHOOTER (RED):
- Hold Alt Fire to charge a piercing beam that ricochets off surfaces. Can destroy projectiles.
