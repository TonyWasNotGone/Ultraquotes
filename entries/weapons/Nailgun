DATA:
A combination of parts from an industrial nailgun and an old bullet gun. Most likely engineered by a machine that was built for construction work, as all machines, even those not built for war, had to learn to fend for themselves after the extinction of mankind.

Bullet guns were largely abandoned after the invention of infinite ammunition systems such as electric weapons and heat weapons, largely due to how much cheaper not having to buy ammunition for large-scale armies becomes overtime.

Although the original ammunition system made it useless and largely abandoned, this gun was still excellently designed and built, so with some retrofitting of parts from an industrial nailgun, it has become a rapid-fire projectile weapon with practically infinite metal ammunition.

As is to be expected from an improvised weapon though, its design is far from perfect. As the nail regeneration system was not designed to work at such a high rate, it's liable to overheat if a hard rate limit isn't set on it, though some variants have instead opted for built-in heatsinks.

STRATEGY:
- Due to the nature of its limited ammunition, the nailgun is best used in short bursts rather than extended periods of time.

- The Magnet variation's magnets will also affect the nails from other nailgun variations, allowing the bypassing of otherwise limiting factors such as the burst from the Overheat variation having poor accuracy.

- Some enemies, such as Malicious Faces, are generally weak to nails, and in particular the higher quality nails from the hard-limited Magnet variation will decimate most weak foes.

ADVANCED STRATEGY:
- Nails become embedded in enemies, causing some special effects. Electric weapons will receive a damage boost from hitting an enemy that has nails in it, and with enough nails, light enemies become magnetized and pulled by the Magnet variation's magnets, allowing for easy temporary disabling of durable light enemies.

- The speed of the barrels' spin carries over between variations, meaning shooting even once with the Magnet variation gives maximum heat for the Overheat variation, allowing for an instant full overheat burst.

ATTRACTOR (BLUE):
- Alt fire to shoot a magnet that pulls all nearby nails towards it. Magnets stick to surfaces and enemies and can be broken with hitscan weapons.
OVERHEAT (GREEN):
- Alt fire while shooting to overheat for a quick burst of high damage at the cost of a heatsink. Heatsinks recharge while not firing.
JUMPSTART (RED):
- Press Alt Fire to attach a cable that slowly charges a powerful electric shock. Attached cables persist when switching weapons.
