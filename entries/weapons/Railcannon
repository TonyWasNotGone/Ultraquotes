DATA:
This industrial tool was one of the earliest uses for the technology that eventually became electric guns.

Originally meant as a handheld generator, allowing for an easy way to generate electricity for temporary relocation, such as encampments during wars or expeditions.

As with most similar industrial tools, once mankind fell, it was repurposed as a weapon by the machine that wielded it, turning it from a lower voltage constant output into a single extremely high burst of energy that requires a long recharge time between shots.

Although a risky weapon, since its recharge time is so long, the railcannon's power makes it a worthy tool to wield, especially for someone carrying multiple weapons that they can use while the railcannon's battery recharges.

STRATEGY:
- Each variation serves a different purpose, and since they all share the same cooldown, it's important to know which version to use in any given situation.

- Total recharge time is 16 seconds. Current charge is indicated by a lightning bolt on the HUD.

ADVANCED STRATEGY:
- The Electric variation can hit the Marksman revolver's coins. Since it has infinite piercing power, with good timing and positioning one can shoot through an enemy to hit a coin, which will then ricochet the shot back into the same enemy, more than doubling the total damage dealt by a single shot.

- By using the Feedbacker arm to punch an enemy that the Screwdriver variation's screw is attached to, it can be relaunched, dealing an extra burst of damage to the enemy. If the screw hits another enemy, its timer will be fully reset, meaning a screw can be juggled between enemies practically infinitely with good timing and aim, though it will break if the enemy it's attached to dies.

- The Malicious variation's explosion range and damage can be greatly increased by hitting an airborne core from the Core Eject shotgun. This technique is highly risky, since missing means wasting the entire shot and having to wait another 16 seconds, but its rewards are bountiful.

ELECTRIC (BLUE):
- A powerful instant piercing shot. Pierces through all enemies. Pay attention to your positioning to maximize destruction. Don't use in water.
SCREWDRIVER (GREEN):
- Fires a powerful drill that sticks to an enemy and deals damage over time. The drill causes enemies to bleed continuously with extra healing range.
MALICIOUS (RED):
- Fires an instant beam that causes a large explosion on impact, similar to a certain familiar face. Wipes out groups of weak enemies with ease.
