DATA:
An experimental close range weapon that uses hyperconcentrated heat as its projectiles.

After each shot, the shotgun must be opened to allow its heat-generating cores to vent excess heat, stopping them from melting or exploding. This process is largely automated, requiring little more from the user than a flick of the wrist.

In the case of core failure, the pump can be used as a manual heat building mechanism. This process has been simplified via a small button near the grip that pumps the shotgun without requiring physical force from the user, though its ease of use has also greatly increased the reported amount of misfires from users pumping too much heat into a single shot.

Heat weapons never caught on as much as electric weapons due to their volatile nature and strict cooling requirements, but unlike electric weapons, they don't require a separate projectile, making their ammunition truly infinite rather than just practically infinite.

STRATEGY:
- The shotgun is only effective at extremely close ranges, making it a risky but very devastating damage dealer. This also makes it ideal for healing.

- Can parry melee attacks via a point-blank shot to the chest. Riskier than using the Feedbacker arm, but with higher damage as a reward.

ADVANCED STRATEGY:
- Quickly swapping weapons skips the wait time after a shot, allowing for continuous bursts of massive damage at the risk of having to stay close for an extended period of time.

- The Core Eject variation's core can be shot out of the air via a hitscan weapon such as the Revolver to increase the radius and damage of its explosion. An already explosive hitscan will increase its radius even further.

- The slowness of the condensed heat projectiles may seem like a detriment at first, but this means that a well timed punch with the Feedbacker arm can hit them, parrying one's own shot for far greater accuracy, speed and damage.

CORE EJECT (BLUE):
- Press Alt Fire to overheat and launch the shotgun's cores. Hold to charge distance. Explodes on impact.
PUMP CHARGE (GREEN):
- Press Alt Fire to pump your shotgun, increasing the power and decreasing the accuracy of your next shot. Too many pumps will cause an explosion when fired.
SAWED-ON (RED):
- Hold Alt Fire to rev chainsaw. Release to launch, piercing enemies and returning back. Can be punched to keep active.
