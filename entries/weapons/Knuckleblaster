DATA:
Slow punch with great damage and knockback. Hold Punch to blast shells inside the knuckles, causing a shockwave that knocks surrounding enemies away.

The Knuckleblaster is a robotic arm generously donated by V2. It sports a red and gray color scheme, with three clawed fingers, two exhaust pipes hanging off the side, and a slot on the top of the forearm that exposes the mechanical insides. There are two "knuckles" from which shotgun shells explode and eject, with two additional screws adjacent to them. When reloading, the vertical slot on the forearm pulls back, likely indicating some sort of mechanism that replaces the shells. 

Pressing the melee key (F by default) while this arm is equipped will punch with a slower rate of fire than the Feedbacker. Holding down the melee key will make the Knuckleblaster create a shockwave that pushes back enemies and deflects projectiles, albeit with less accuracy compared to the Feedbacker. The shockwave deals 1 point of damage to enemies. Directly punching enemies will deal 2.5 damage.

Some enemies will explode upon dealing a killing blow with a direct Knuckleblaster punch, giving the player over 100 health. 

Using the melee to "Parry" the Sawed-on Shotgun's chainsaw will detatch and launch it. When the shockwave hits a Coin or Core Eject Shotgun core, it will launch it away. When you use the ability right when the shockwave happens, you can launch the ability extremly far away.
Primarily used on Coins to setup an Orbital Coinstrike.
