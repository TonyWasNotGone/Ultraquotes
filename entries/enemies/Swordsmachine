TYPE: Greater Machine

DATA:
Its original form is unrecognisable after years of scavenging scrap and rebuilding itself, but among scrapheads, the Swordsmachine is quite famous due to its combat prowess and selfmade[sic] form, ugly to most but beautiful to enthusiasts, spawning many copycats.

It wields a selfmade sword with a motor on it that, when revved, will heat the blade, cutting through most organic matter with ease.

Due to its possessive hoarding behavior, it's one of the few machines still capable of vocalization -- an ability most have discarded for more efficient resource management.

STRATEGY:
- Despite its excellent performance against Hell's denizens, its design does not take into account extremely mobile opponents, so the best way to avoid its blade is to jump out of its vertical range.

- Its motorized sword makes for predictable attacks, making the Swordsmachine an excellent target for parrying.

- Although its use of ranged weapons is primitive at best, its sword throws can be unexpectedly accurate thanks to its mastery of the weapon.
