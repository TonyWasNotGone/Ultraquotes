TYPE: Supreme Machine

DATA:
After its defeat and escape, V2 dove deeper into Hell, killing other machines for their blood to help its recovery with the intent of taking revenge on V1 and recovering its original arm.

After finding a temporary replacement from one of its victims, V2 used parts from other machines to transform the new placeholder arm into a mobility tool that would allow it to catch up to V1's fast descent into the deeper layers.

In order to prepare for their second and final encounter, it researched the combat data from their previous battle to copy strategies and techniques from the older and more experienced V1 to give itself an upper hand.

However, despite all its preparation, V2 lost again, and unable to escape this time, was brought to a swift and decisive end by its predecessor.

STRATEGY:
- Although V2's coins may seem extremely dangerous at first, they are also an excellent opportunity for high damage if shot before V2 can.

- V2's nailgun can be circumvented or turned against itself via Magnets.

- Hitting V2 with its own arm will cause it to enrage instantly.
