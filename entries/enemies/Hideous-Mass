TYPE: Greater Demon

DATA:
Hideous Masses are a rare occurrence, when an excessive amount of Hell Mass is poured into a single shell, causing it to overflow and burst at the seams.

Due to the broken seams allowing for mobility without having to bend the exterior, the stone has hardened more than the shell of most demons, making it completely impervious to all currently known attacks.

STRATEGY:
- Although its stone exterior makes for an impenetrable defense, the Hideous Mass' belly and tail remain exposed and vulnerable.

- While standing up, a quick burst of close range damage is the most effective way to hurt them, though this will most likely cause it to change formations, so being quick and decisive is the key.

- When in its low formation, keeping a safe distance is recommended due to its melee capabilities and high speed tail harpoon, though the brave or suicidal may attempt to climb on its back to continue dealing close range damage to the tail.

- When caught by the harpoon, it's recommendable to either punch the harpoon or damage the tail to remove it.
