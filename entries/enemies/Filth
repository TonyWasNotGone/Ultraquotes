    TYPE: Lesser Husk

    DATA:
    Husks are physical manifestations of the souls of the damned.

    The physical form is based on the value of the original soul, which is determined by the strength of its will and its prevalence in public consciousness: the living souls that remember it.

    Filth are the lowest form of Husk, whose souls were too weak and unimportant to even form a complete physical body.

    Even among Husks, they have the lowest intelligence, driven purely by hunger.

    STRATEGY:
    - Most weapons are easily capable of taking down Filth, but their powerful jaws and sheer numbers can overwhelm a target quickly if underestimated.

    - Explosives are the most effective way to take down swarms, but any weapon that can hit more than one target will be efficient.
