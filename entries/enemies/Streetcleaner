TYPE: LESSER MACHINE

DATA:
Originally built as a way to purify the tainted air of cities after the climate catastrophe, Streetcleaners were made obsolete during the New Peace, and were repurposed as scouts for Hell expeditions.

However, their urge to clean remained, and after the fall of mankind, they began burning any organic matter they came across in an effort to purify the world.

STRATEGY: 
- Due to their combat experience, they can be tricky to take down with projectiles or explosives.

- The canister on their back is a major weakpoint that can be shattered with a precision shot, such as a Marksman coin ricochet from behind.

- Point-blank attacks can also be very efficient, but must be performed quickly to avoid the fire of their flamethrowers.
