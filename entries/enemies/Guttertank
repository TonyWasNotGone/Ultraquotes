TYPE: Greater Machine

DATA:
As Guttermen singlehandedly ended the trench warfare era of the Final War, armies scrambled to create countermeasures, leading to the creation of more machines of war.

Built from the foundations of Guttermen to save time, Guttertanks were equipped with highly efficient explosives and arms capable of damaging and destroying thick armor. The slow, lumbering walls that once dominated the battlefield had now become obsolete.

As human soldiers had quickly become useless in war, utterly outclassed by machines, they were almost entirely phased out. This led to the second era of the Final War, where machines fought machines in a back-and-forth tide as new designs were phased in and out at a feverish pace, each designed specifically to counter the last.

Although at first the soldiers celebrated returning home, they soon found that the pointless, endless arms race left little in its wake. All resources were used on machines of war, and impoverished civilians had to struggle to survive. Home was just another battlefield, a war of all against all.

Conquest leads to war - War leads to famine - Famine leads to...

STRATEGY:
- The Guttertank's punch is deceptively fast and powerful. The best way to get close safely is to bait a punch before closing the gap.

- Due to reused technology, the Freezeframe Rocket Launcher is capable of freezing Guttertank rockets too, making them temporarily incapable of long range combat.
