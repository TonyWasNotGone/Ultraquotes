TYPE: Greater Machine

DATA:
Rare but extremely dangerous, the Mindflayer is a machine that has adapted and mastered the use of Hell Energy alongside its own technological prowess.

The machine itself is only the top part of its apparent body, the rest of which is a plastic shell in the form of a human, which they seem to have built themselves.

The plastic body serves no function and is only for aesthetic purposes.

Despite it being a waste of resources, Mindflayers will use everything in its power to protect the plastic body from harm, even if that means destroying itself in the process.

Mindflayers seem to prefer a female form, though very rare occasions of male forms have also been recorded.

STRATEGY:
- When encountering a Mindflayer, it's imperative to keep track of their actions either through visuals or audio.

- Due to their homing projectiles being fired in a burst, a safe explosive such as a Knuckleblaster blastwave is the most efficient in deflecting them.

- Their instant teleportation can make consistent positional advantage quite difficult, but a Screwdriver drill will temporarily stop them from teleporting.
