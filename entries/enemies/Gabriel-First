TYPE: Supreme Angel

DATA:
One of the most respected and feared archangels, Gabriel earned his reputation through power and efficiency.

Regardless of the task given, Gabriel would always perform it quickly and decisively, earning him the title of Judge of Hell after dethroning Minos and ending the Lust renaissance.

Despite answering to the Council, he is far more popular and beloved among angels due to his radiant personality and active nature, especially compared to the Council that strictly follows and upholds the dogma of the Faith.

STRATEGY:
- Gabriel's movements are fast and his attacks are deadly, but by observing which weapon he manifests, his attacks can be accurately predicted before he even starts them.

- Gabriel's pride stops him from attacking while taunting his opponent, opening up a short window for healing.
