The Minotaur, one of the oldest known surviving demons, was sculpted by ████ ██████ as a gift for the then Judge of Hell, Minos, in an attempt to form some kind of rapport.

Though its creator considered it beautiful, a personalized monument of death and despair, Minos was terrified of the gross caricature of his past mistakes and cast it into the Garden of Forking Paths, hoping it would never be seen again.

Now the Minotaur is old and its body failing, falling apart, running blind through the labyrinth in a desperate attempt to break out. Its only desire: to see the sky for one last time.

STRATEGY:
- Although difficult to heal from due to its distance, it is best to be patient. New trams will often arrive, carrying weaker foes for easier healing.

- Much of its body is protected, but its guts are exposed, making for an easy consistent target.
