TYPE: Lesser Demon

DATA:
Although they do not resemble the mythological three-headed dog, this name was chosen due to their nature as protectors of Hell. However, itâ€™s not yet known why some stay dormant despite provocation.

Despite the fact that keeping an energy orb stable takes a considerable amount of focus and effort, they seem to always keep one in hand, most likely as a display of their power to scare off intruders.

STRATEGY:
- Due to remaining entirely stationary until awoken, they move quite slowly, so engagement distance is easy to control.

- They're quite adept at ranged combat by throwing their orb, but in order to avoid damaging themselves, they will not initiate a throw while their target is close, which can be used to manipulate their behavior, though once a throw has started, it cannot be stopped.

- Due to the extreme concentration of their energy orbs, thrown ones explode on physical impact, so staying close to surfaces such as the floor or any walls will make avoiding ranged attacks more difficult.
