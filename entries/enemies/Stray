TYPE: Lesser Husk

DATA:
While their tall stature may seem intimidating, Strays are afraid of most danger and will try to stay at a safe distance, only attacking via projectiles formed with Hell Energy.

Although controlling and manifesting this energy is a complicated task, Strays have very low intelligence and are only able to do so via pure instinct.

Nevertheless, humans were unable to replicate this level of accuracy and control, particularily[sic] the Strayâ€™s ability to cause the energy orbs to selectively ignore other Husks.

STRATEGY:
- Most weapons will be effective against them, but a Revolver headshot is the quickest and surest way to eliminate a Stray.

- Due to their static nature and slow rate of attacking, they are an excellent target for projectile parrying.
