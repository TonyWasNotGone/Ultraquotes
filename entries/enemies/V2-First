TYPE: Supreme Machine

DATA:
The V model was built for war, with V1 boasting a new kind of exterior plating that allowed refueling through contact with blood rather than through a separate blood refueling process.

Due to its necessary thinness, it is far less durable, but the ability to fix itself and rebuild broken parts on the fly would outweigh the negatives on an active battlefield.

However, during the prototyping phase, the New Peace was established and war became irrelevant.

V1’s planned production was cancelled and an updated model, V2, was developed instead, using the standardized plating, since durability was far more important during times of peace when no bloodshed was necessary.

Neither model ever reached mass production due to the end of wars completely draining any demand, so it’s likely only a single prototype build of each model remains in existence.

STRATEGY:
- V2 is adept at controlling space and will take advantage of this to change the flow of battle to throw off its opponent. Stay too close and it will run away. Stay far away and it will come close.

- V2's high mobility makes it a tricky target to hit, and especially difficult to heal off of. When in need of blood and unable to catch up, it is instead recommended to stay away from it and let it come to you instead.

- V2 will switch weapons depending on the distance from its target, so if one of its weapons is difficult to avoid, a change in proximity will close it off.

- Knowledge of the synergies of one's own arsenal can allow one to turn V2's weapons against it.
