TYPE: Lesser Demon

DATA:
Although they can easily be mistaken to be of divine origin, Idols were created using the same process as other demons. Unlike their larger kin, their shells were too small to contain a useful amount of Hell Mass, creating life, but leaving it unable to move or act.

The Idols did not originally look divine, but were painstakingly carved to such shapes by Ferrymen who collected them during travels across the layers of Hell. This was done as both an act of compassion and as a tribute to angels, particularily[sic] Gabriel, whom Ferrymen believe to have similarily[sic] granted them mercy.

Close proximity to a Ferryman's holy cloth during the long and arduous carving process caused its holy power to seep into them, allowing them to continue the chain of compassion by protecting others from physical harm.

It is fortunate for them that Gabriel is the only angel of Heaven's higher order to watch over Hell, since if the Council had found out about such beings, they would have been labelled perversions of the divine form and ordered to be destroyed by the Ferrymen who so lovingly had granted them a chance at life.

STRATEGY:
- Although Idols are immune to projectiles, they can be destroyed by a blunt force melee attack such as a punch or a ground slam.

- Blessed enemies cannot be damaged by attacks, but will still be pushed by physical forces and can be killed by environmental dangers, such as crushers or fans.

- Neither Idols nor blessed enemies can be grappled onto with the Whiplash.
