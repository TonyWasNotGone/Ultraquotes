TYPE: Lesser Machine

DATA:
A mass-produced security device built as both a surveillance camera and a security guard.

Though originally built to only use non-lethal ammunition, they have scavenged parts from the defunct machines on the surface for greater efficiency at collecting blood.

Curious by nature, but to keep production costs low, their intelligence is very limited.

STRATEGY:
- Due to their light weight, physical projectiles such as nails will push them around, making them harder to deal consistent damage to.

- On death they will make a last ditch effort to harm their opponent with a self-destruct, but powerful single attacks and explosives will make them explode instantly.

- Punching a drone will redirect their suicide dive, making them a high-risk offensive opportunity.

- Their scanning mechanism makes a chirping sound, which can be listened for to make them easier to track down, as their flight and small size can lead them to hard to reach places.
