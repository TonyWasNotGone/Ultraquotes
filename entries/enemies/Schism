TYPE: Greater Husk

DATA:
The result of two souls attempting to manifest in the same space, causing an amalgamation of two physical bodies.

Due to the doubled body mass, theyâ€™re quite resilient to damage, but have very poor motor control and thus cannot aim with any degree of accuracy, resorting to barrages of energy orbs in the general direction of their opponent.

STRATEGY:
- Piercer revolver's charged headshots are an efficient tool for a quick kill against Schisms, though their displaced head can make aiming difficult for the inexperienced.

- A point-blank Pump Charge shotgun blast with 2 pumps will be able to take them down in a single shot.

- Due to their poor aim, they aren't a priority target, but the sheer amount of projectiles can sometimes make avoiding them tricky in busy encounters.
