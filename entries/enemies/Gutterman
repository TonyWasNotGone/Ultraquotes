TYPE: GREATER MACHINE

DATA:
Built in the early days of the Final War, the Guttermen were one of the first successful experiments in using blood as a fuel source, as well as the first automatons to be deployed in wide-scale conflict.

During the War's first phase, an era of trench warfare, these seemingly unstoppable walls were airdropped into enemy trenches, which they would then slowly and systematically clear out as all opposing soldiers would have to choose between being minced by the Gutterman, or running out of the trench and getting mowed down by machine gun fire.

Researchers had not yet found a way to keep blood inside the machine fresh, so a live fuel source was strapped inside, kept alive by minimal life support, before the Guttermen were welded shut. Although publically these fuel sources were claimed to be volunteer patriots, most were deserters, battle-fatigued returnees or prisoners of war.

Forces from far beyond took notice of the cruelty man was capable of, and the suffering of these human blood supplies served as an inspiration for the creation of Mannequins.

STRATEGY:
- The shield is a Gutterman's main defense. Destroying it with the Knuckleblaster or a Landmine will cause them to take increased damage.

- Although slow at first, their tracking will improve the longer they maintain line of sight. It's best not to stay out in the open for too long.

- Once the shield has been broken, the Gutterman's punches can be parried, which resets their tracking.

- A Gutterman's corpse can be ground slammed to cause a large explosion that damages surrounding enemies and launches the attacker high in the air.
