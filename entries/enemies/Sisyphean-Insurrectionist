TYPE: Supreme Husk

DATA:
The Sisyphean Insurrectionists were an army of Husks gathered and trained by King Sisyphus for overthrowing Heaven's control of Hell, freeing the sinners from their eternal torment.

During an era of chaos in Heaven, as the angelic watch was absent, Sisyphus began setting his plan in motion as his forces recruited all Husks that were intelligent enough to be useful to their cause and began attacking the demons that wandered the dunes of Greed.

Upon the establishment of the Council and subsequent return of peace to Heaven, Gabriel and an army of angels were sent down to crush the insurrection and subjugate Sisyphus' army.

Although their battle was well-fought, the inexperienced Insurrectionists could not match the educated strategy of the angels, who quickly descended upon King Sisyphus with great force, eventually overpowering and killing him, leaving the Insurrectionists without a chain of command.

Left scattered and disoriented, the warriors were easily picked off one by one, their bodies cut apart, leaving behind only the bare essentials required to carry on their eternal punishment of hauling heavy boulders up the monuments of mankind's arrogance and greed.

Although the blood of their enemies still stains their bodies and their grasp still clutches their fallen foes, their will and fierce fury only serve as mental torment in knowing how close they were to freedom.

STRATEGY:
- The Sisyphean Insurrectionists soak their feet in the blood of their enemies to protect them from the heat of Greed's dunes, but the rest of their body is still skin and flesh, which can be set aflame to greatly weaken their defences, increasing the damage of any attack dealt to them.

- Though they have practically unlimited range, each of the Insurrectionist's swings has strengths and weaknesses. Learning which way to dodge to avoid each attack is vital.

- The Insurrectionist's stomp is fast and destructive, so it's inadvisable to stay close for long.

- The Malicious Face they wield as a weapon is not a part of their body, so hitting it will not deal damage to an Insurrectionist, but this also means that it can still be used to heal even if its wielder's blood has been turned to sand.
