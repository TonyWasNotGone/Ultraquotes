TYPE: Supreme Demon

DATA:
Unlike most demons, the Leviathan is not formed from generic Hell Mass, but instead from the bodies of the Sullen, a name used for those in the Ocean Styx who have given up fighting for air and instead lay at the bottom of the ocean, drowning eternally.

The Sullen, in their motionlessness, were eventually fused together by the same force that created the other demons, becoming the biblical Leviathan, an abomination prophesied to be at the end of the world.

The heart, which houses the souls of the Sullen in endless anguish as their flesh, veins and nerves writhe and mutate, attempted to escape its body, but Gabriel struck it down with his divine spears, pinning it back onto its head, unable to move.

Although the world ended, the Leviathan remains trapped in the Ocean Styx, growing ever longer as more of Wrath's sinners give up and sink to the bottom.

STRATEGY:
- The Leviathan's heart is exposed on top of its head, making it a clear weakpoint to aim for. Although it's usually not visible, it can be seen after the Leviathan's attacks, opening an opportunity for direct damage, or for landing a magnet.

- Although ill-advised, it is possible to ride the Leviathan for a short period of time. A well-timed jump will allow one to dodge the Leviathan's bite attack as well as land on its head near its exposed heart.

- The tail will either swing high or low, and the height of the swing can be determined by the direction in which the swing rotates.
