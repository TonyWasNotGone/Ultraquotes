TYPE: Greater Machine

DATA:
One of the many war machines created during the Final War. Although there were attempts to find new purpose for them during the New Peace, their streamlined design made them unable to be repurposed until the start of the Hell expeditions.

Their extremely powerful legs and feet allow them to dig into the ground, making them immovable by most forces and allowing them to easily line up any shot without interruption.

Despite their size, they were built to be extremely light, which when combined with the power of their legs, allows them to move at extremely fast speeds. Such power and lightness have made their legs one of the most sought after parts by scrapheads.

Most machines will only render a simplified approximation of their visual surroundings for faster processing speed, but Sentries use full renders instead, giving them perfect accuracy even over extremely long distances.

STRATEGY:
- Due to their powerful legs, once they've dug into the ground to aim, they can no longer move.

- Once dug in, the only ways to interrupt their attack are: Shooting them with the Electric Railcannon, hitting their antenna with the Revolver, launching them with the ground slam wave or punching them with the Knuckleblaster.

- As long as they haven't dug in, their light weight makes them easy to launch and keep in the air where they are harmless.

- A good way to disable a Sentry for a longer period of time is to shoot nails into them with the Nailgun and then placing a magnet in a nearby wall or ceiling, which will pull them once they've been knocked off balance.
