TYPE: Lesser Demon

DATA:
During the departure of the angels after the Disappearance of God, many sinners attempted to escape the Violence layer, braving the labyrinth that lay at its edges, thinking they could find a way out in the absence of Heaven's wardens.

The fools who attempted would realize far too late that angels were not all that kept them from freedom, as the Garden of Forking Paths is no ordinary labyrinth, but with malicious intent, overseen with cunning cruelty.

The halls, similar enough to give no sense of direction, but different enough to grant no familiarity, would eventually exhaust each escapee, and as they fell into a deep sleep, their metamorphosis began.

Each sinner was torn apart joint by joint, their broken and shattered limbs shoved into hollow statues, starting them to life as the flesh and blood of Mannequins.

The gift of death is a rare privilege in Hell, so sinners who attempted to control their fate now lie in eternal agony, unable to now control even their own bodies, which now continue to carry on the same punishment to other unfortunate fools.

STRATEGY:
- Though they are nimble, if a Mannequin is knocked into the air or hit while clinging to a surface, they lose their balance when landing, granting a small window for an easier hit. Those fast enough may even punch them in the air while they're vulnerable, killing them in a single blow.

- Mannequin projectiles can be difficult to avoid due to their homing capabilities, but this makes them even easier to parry with the Feedbacker arm.

- Mannequins are easier to hit with the larger radius of explosives, but are more resistant to them than other weaponry.
